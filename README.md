This project includes a class for fitting and decoding HMMs (currently only
discrete emission spaces are supported; extension to GMM is tentatively planned). <br>
The code is tested on a toy example from Wikipedia, as well as real-life example
using gas sensor data. <br>
The jupyter notebook contains the entirety of the code (which should be broken 
out into a proper library in the future), and includes significant exploration
and pre-processing of the MOX gas sensor data. 

## Environment <br>
Code tested with: <br>
+ Python 3.5.2 <br>
+ numpy 1.16.4 <br>
+ pandas 0.24.2 <br>
+ matplotlib 2.2.3 <br>
+ hmmlearn 0.2.3  
<br>
